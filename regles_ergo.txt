HOW TO PLAY ERGO
Ergo is played in a series of rounds, each consisting of a series of turns.
THE ROUND
During each round, players attempt to collectively build a Proof that proves
their existence, while disproving the existence of any other player.
When a Proof is stopped, the round ends and the players score points
as appropriate. All cards are collected and then shuffled; another five
cards are dealt to each player and another round begins. The rounds
continue until a single player achieves enough points to secure victory
over the entire game (see Ending a Round and Winning the Game,
respectively, below).
A TURN
At the beginning of all rounds, the youngest player starts a turn. Each
player, in clockwise order, then takes a turn, following the same steps
until the round stops.
On each turn a player must always draw two cards and then play two
cards. If the player does not want to play a card(s) to the Proof—or if
the player cannot play a card(s) to the Proof—the player must discard.
At the end of each player’s turn, they will always have five cards in
their hand.
